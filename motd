Jupyter Notebook Docker Container / Jorge Donato / jmdonato1@sbcglobal.net
===========================================================================
* The container will be listening for connections on TCP port 8000: will be
  redirected to the container's Jupyter Notebook.
* The /root/jupyter directory will mount Docker volume ~/jupyter on your  
  computer.  Configure the "-v" mount as desired. (Free advice: not "/")
* To set a password once and not use the temporary token, type:

	1.  Exit the console python session with:  >  exit
	2.  Run the following:                     $ jupyter-notebook password

* Help with Python magic commands:  %lsmagic
* Jupyter will be listening on port 8000 by default. The port continues to 
  listen in the background even if Jupyter-Console is exited.
* TensorFlow is not automatically installed.  Either:
	1. Install tensorflow from a python3 wheel file:
		# pip3 install tensorflow-v1.11.0*whl
	  OR
	2. Run ./tf_build (to build tensorflow from source code.  Good for
	   CPUs that do not support the "avx2" instruction set.
	   NOTE: Takes many hours to build from source.
		# ./tf_build -s11
* Jupyter-Console (CLI) will start momentarily.
